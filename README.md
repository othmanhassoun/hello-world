My name is Othman Hassoun, and I'm currently a student at Ivy Tech studying software development. I have a passion for programming and enjoy delving into various programming languages and technologies to develop innovative solutions. I'm constantly seeking opportunities to expand my knowledge and skills in the field of software development. Whether it's building applications, solving complex problems, or collaborating with others, I find great fulfillment in the world of programming.
